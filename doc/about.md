## About

I suddenly bought the cheapest chinese BDF netbook. It's a real crab both in hardware and especially in software. Some genius installed Android 5, so the device is totally unusable in any way.

As you know, support is also chinese. I uselessly spend two months kicking the ass of seller, asking about a contact of any technical specialist to consult about SDK and tools let me build my own system for this scrap.

I visit [Actions Semiconductor](http://www.actions-semi.com/) website. There is nothing about [ATM7029] SoC!
Luckily Google let me find some tools and posts to uncover this thing and 
build a custom embedded Linux system.
