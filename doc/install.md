## Install

To build and install the system you should download source code archives from <https://github.com/ponyatov/ATM7029/releases/latest> and install some tools separately.

Installation process was automated:
```
$ cd ~
$ unzip ~/Downloads/ATM7029-190806.zip
$ cd ATM7029-190806
$ make install
```

You need to install some tools noted later into the VM with Windows XP running.
